InDBFS - Overview
=================

<p style='text-align:justify'>This project tends to provide a polyfill for the FileSystem as specified in W3C specification <a href='http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/file-dir-sys.html'>here.</a> Nowadays (02/06/2013) the native support for the said FileSystem is present in Chrome only while plans of Firefox and IExplorer dev teams regarding it are unclear. W3C spec is still in a recomendation state where documentation is a working draft.</p>
